## Reproducible examples

Reproducible examples [allow someone else to recreate your problem by just copying and pasting R code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html)

]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

But they can be tedious to write. The {reprex} package helps with that!

## Writing reproducible examples

Let's say you want a reproducible example for generating a sequence of numbers that counts by 2, but can only make it count by 1 currently. There are a few ways to do this:

\#1 **Copy** your code to your clipboard and then run `reprex()`

\#2 **Wrap** your code with `reprex()`


```r
reprex(seq(1, 10))
```

\#3 **Wrap** an input filepath with `reprex()`


```r
reprex(input = "my_reprex.R")
```

\#4 Use the reprex **RStudio Addin**

You'll then have a **reprex** in your clipboard to paste! Since `reprex()` is meant to be run interactively, avoid leaving it in your code.

``` r
seq(1, 10)
#&gt;  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

&lt;sup&gt;Created on 2020-03-19 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.3.0)&lt;/sup&gt;
---

## \#1: Write Comments liberally 

In order to leave descriptive comments throughout, it's often easier to write multi-line code.


```r
reprex({ # &lt;- notice the {} enclosing the code
  # I want to count by 2
  seq(1, 10)
  # But I can only figure out how to count by 1
})
```


``` r
# I want to count by 2
seq(1, 10)
#&gt;  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
# But I can only figure out how to count by 1
```

This also helps readers spot your problem and see your thought process. It can also greatly help you resolve your own question! 
---

## \#2: Use data that others can use

The general advice is to make your data as **boring** as possible. This means try to use data that is readily available like `mtcars` or `iris`. But let's say you have a more specific question. 



You might post this code on StackOverflow and ask: Why are all my averages NA?


```r
df %&gt;%
  group_by(person) %&gt;%
  summarise(average = mean(total))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   person average
##   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 A           NA
## 2 B           NA
## 3 C           NA
```

But, no one else can run your code to see where things go wrong :(

---

Without more context, it's really tough to see the problem. With a combination of {datapasta} &amp; {reprex} we can write a much better question! In general we want the smallest dataset possible, so I like to use `head()` to get just a few rows.


```r
library(datapasta)
```

```
## Warning: package 'datapasta' was built under R version 3.5.3
```

```r
x &lt;- tribble_construct(head(df)) 
 # writes code to reconstruct table
cat(x)
```

```
## tibble::tribble(
##   ~person,        ~date, ~total,
##       "A", "2020-01-01",    "3",
##       "B", "2020-01-01",    "3",
##       "C", "2020-01-01",    "1",
##       "A", "2020-02-01",    "2",
##       "B", "2020-02-01",    "3",
##       "C", "2020-02-01",    "2"
##   )
```

---

Then we can post a better question with the data included:

``` r
library(dplyr)
df &lt;- tibble::tribble(
  ~person,        ~date, ~total,
  "A", "2020-01-01",    "3",
  "B", "2020-01-01",    "3",
  "C", "2020-01-01",    "1",
  "A", "2020-02-01",    "1",
  "B", "2020-02-01",    "3",
  "C", "2020-02-01",    "1"
)
df %&gt;%
  group_by(person) %&gt;%
  summarise(average = mean(total)) # I expected this to give 1 for C, for example. But it's NA

#&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2
#&gt;   person average
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
#&gt; 1 A           NA
#&gt; 2 B           NA
#&gt; 3 C           NA
```

And someone will be able to help you see that your numbers are actually characters, thus giving NA! Much easier than the previous guesswork.

## \#3 Shorter code is better &amp; clean up after yourself

Maybe later on you want to plot your data and change the colors. But we don't need to know that to answer the wrangling question!






&lt;code class ='r hljs remark-code'&gt;library(tidyverse)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:pink'&gt;library(colorspace)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:pink'&gt;library(ggthemes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;df %&gt;%&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;group_by(person) %&gt;%&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;summarise(average = mean(total)) # I expected this to give 1 for C, for example. But it's NA&lt;/code&gt;

And if you write a file, delete it after! But do **not** delete anything you didn't write.


```r
...
write_file(df, "output.csv")
file.remove("output.csv")
```


---
## \#4 `sessionInfo` is a helpful look at your environment

If you have old/out-of-date packages, this is easiest to see with your session information. It's a summary of your R version, packages, and their versions.

There are two ways to include this information:


```r
# argument to reprex()
reprex(..., si = TRUE)

# OR

# manually include the function
reprex({
  ...
  sessionInfo()
})
```


---
## \#5 Test your question in a fresh R session before posting it

Often you'll solve your own problem by writing a **good** question! You may find that you had overwritten an object or another somewhat-invisible error.

To make sure that the code will run on someone else's machine, make sure to test it in a **NEW** R session. Don't just clear your environment! This is not the same thing. 

You can do this by clicking `Session` -&gt; `Restart R`

Or with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl[cmd]+shift+F10`
